{"id":"wf-58w","title":"Build countdown timer application with Agent Mail integration","description":"## Feature Request\n\nBuild a real-world countdown timer application that demonstrates Agent Mail integration for cross-agent communication and coordination.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAgent Mail (https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) is an MCP server that enables AI agents to communicate asynchronously via a message queue system. Building a countdown timer application serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. **Learn Agent Mail**: Practical experience with MCP-based agent communication\n2. **Real Application**: Create a useful tool (multiple timers with alarms)\n3. **Demonstrate Coordination**: Show how agents can coordinate on building a complete application\n4. **Test Workflow**: Exercise beads issue tracking in a realistic development scenario\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Multiple Timers**: User can create multiple countdown timers running simultaneously\n2. **Timer Management**: Start, pause, resume, cancel, and reset individual timers\n3. **Visual Display**: Show remaining time for all active timers\n4. **Audio Alarms**: Sound notification when timer completes\n5. **Persistent State**: Save timer state so they survive application restart\n6. **Agent Coordination**: Use Agent Mail for agents to coordinate implementation tasks\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a terminal-based countdown timer application with:\n\n**Technology Stack**:\n- Python or Node.js for the application\n- Agent Mail MCP server for agent-to-agent communication\n- Sound library for alarms (e.g., playsound, beep, or system notification)\n- Simple TUI or CLI interface\n- JSON file for persistence\n\n**Agent Mail Usage**:\n- Coordinate development tasks between multiple AI agents\n- Use message queues to assign subtasks (UI, timer logic, alarm system, etc.)\n- Demonstrate asynchronous agent communication patterns\n\n**Features**:\n- `timer add \u003cname\u003e \u003cduration\u003e` - Create new timer (e.g., \"5m\", \"2h30m\")\n- `timer list` - Show all active timers\n- `timer pause \u003cname\u003e` - Pause a timer\n- `timer resume \u003cname\u003e` - Resume a paused timer\n- `timer cancel \u003cname\u003e` - Cancel a timer\n- `timer reset \u003cname\u003e` - Reset timer to original duration\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Build a web-based timer with real-time updates\n  - Why not chosen: More complex, focus should be on Agent Mail integration not web development\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Simple single-timer application\n  - Why not chosen: Too basic, doesn't showcase agent coordination or complex state management\n  \n- **Alternative 3**: Pomodoro timer specific\n  - Why not chosen: Less flexible than general countdown timers","design":"## Technical Design\n\n[Detailed technical approach]\n\n## API Changes\n\n[New commands, flags, or APIs]\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\n[Database schema changes if any]\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Note 1\n- Note 2\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Unit tests: [scope]\n- Integration tests: [scope]\n- Manual testing: [steps]\n","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Application can create and manage multiple countdown timers simultaneously\n- [ ] Timers support common duration formats (5m, 2h30m, 90s)\n- [ ] Audio alarm sounds when timer completes\n- [ ] Timer state persists across application restarts\n- [ ] All CLI commands (add, list, pause, resume, cancel, reset) work correctly\n- [ ] Agent Mail MCP server successfully coordinates agent tasks\n- [ ] Documentation includes Agent Mail setup and usage examples\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms all features work end-to-end","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-16T12:51:31.969126204-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T13:45:05.826156917-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["application","feature"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"wf-58w","depends_on_id":"wf-dt1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T16:41:23.490283632-08:00","created_by":"rogardle"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-18T13:45:05.826156917-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

{"id":"wf-6pe","title":"Idle Scheduler: per-terminal idle-time scheduler (drop-in Bash module)","description":"# **Drop‑In Bash Module: Idle Scheduler with Randomized Interval**\n\n## **1. Overview**\nThis module provides a **per‑terminal idle‑time scheduler** for Bash.  \nIt executes a user‑defined task **only when the terminal is idle** (i.e., Bash is displaying the prompt and no interactive foreground process is running).  \n\nExecution occurs at **randomized intervals between 20 and 40 seconds** (30 ± 10 seconds jitter).  \nEach terminal session maintains its own independent schedule and state.\n\n---\n\n## **2. What Is a “Drop‑In Bash Module”?**\nA **drop‑in Bash module** is a standalone `.sh` file designed to be:\n\n- **Self‑contained** (no external dependencies)\n- **Safe to source** from `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or a modular directory such as `~/.bashrc.d/`\n- **Non‑intrusive** (does not override user settings unless explicitly intended)\n- **Composable** with other modules\n\nA drop‑in module:\n\n- Should not assume global variables unless it defines them  \n- Should not overwrite existing `PROMPT_COMMAND` logic  \n- Must chain cleanly with other prompt hooks  \n- Should be removable simply by deleting the file\n\nThis module follows those rules.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Goals**\n- Provide a lightweight, dependency‑free idle scheduler.\n- Ensure tasks run **only when the terminal is idle**.\n- Introduce **random jitter** to avoid synchronized behaviour across terminals.\n- Maintain **per‑terminal isolation**.\n- Be installable simply by dropping a file into a Bash module directory.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Non‑Goals**\n- Not a system‑wide scheduler.\n- Not a precise timing mechanism.\n- Not persistent across sessions.\n- Not intended for long‑running background jobs.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Functional Requirements**\n\n### **5.1 Idle Detection**\n- Scheduler runs only when Bash is about to display the prompt.\n- Implemented via `PROMPT_COMMAND`.\n- Must not run while a foreground process is active.\n\n### **5.2 Randomized Interval**\n- After each execution, the next interval is randomly selected.\n- Range: **20–40 seconds**.\n- Uses Bash’s `$RANDOM`.\n\n### **5.3 Per‑Terminal State**\nEach terminal session maintains:\n\n- `LAST_IDLE_RUN` — timestamp of last execution  \n- `NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL` — randomized delay until next run  \n\nState is stored in shell variables scoped to the session.\n\n### **5.4 User‑Defined Task**\n- The module exposes a function `idle_task()` for user override.\n- Default implementation prints a timestamp.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Implementation (Drop‑In Module)**\n\nSave as:  \n`~/.bashrc.d/idle-scheduler.sh`  \n(or any sourced location)\n\n```bash\n# --- Idle Scheduler Module (Drop-In) ---\n\n# User-overridable idle task\nidle_task() {\n    echo \"[idle task] Running at $(date)\"\n}\n\n# Random interval bounds (seconds)\nIDLE_MIN=20\nIDLE_MAX=40\n\n# Initialize state if not already set\nLAST_IDLE_RUN=${LAST_IDLE_RUN:-0}\nNEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL=${NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL:-$(( RANDOM % (IDLE_MAX - IDLE_MIN + 1) + IDLE_MIN ))}\n\n# Preserve existing PROMPT_COMMAND\n__idle_prev_prompt_command=\"$PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\n# Compose new PROMPT_COMMAND\nPROMPT_COMMAND='\\\n  now=$(date +%s)\\\n\\\n  if (( now - LAST_IDLE_RUN \u003e= NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL )); then\\\n      idle_task\\\n      LAST_IDLE_RUN=$now\\\n      NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL=$(( RANDOM % (IDLE_MAX - IDLE_MIN + 1) + IDLE_MIN ))\\\n  fi\\\n\\\n  # Chain previous PROMPT_COMMAND if it exists\\\n  if [[ -n \"$__idle_prev_prompt_command\" ]]; then\\\n      eval \"$__idle_prev_prompt_command\"\\\n  fi\\\n'\n```\n\n---\n\n## **7. Behaviour Examples**\n\n### **7.1 Idle Terminal**\n- User presses Enter repeatedly  \n- Scheduler fires at random intervals  \n- Output appears between prompts\n\n### **7.2 Busy Terminal**\n- User runs `vim`, `top`, `ssh`, etc.  \n- Scheduler does **not** run  \n- Execution resumes when prompt returns\n\n### **7.3 Multiple Terminals**\n- Each terminal has its own independent timer  \n- Random jitter prevents synchronized execution\n\n---\n\n## **8. Extensibility**\n\n### **8.1 Optional Enhancements**\n- Only run when last command succeeded  \n- tmux‑mode awareness  \n- Subshell suppression  \n- Logging hooks  \n- Integration with agent‑based workflows (beads, waif, etc.)\n\n### **8.2 Future Extensions**\n- Pluggable idle‑task registry  \n- Per‑project idle hooks  \n- Adaptive intervals based on load or context  \n\n---\n\n## **9. Risks \u0026 Mitigations**\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Excessive output | Override `idle_task` to silence or redirect |\n| PROMPT_COMMAND conflicts | Module chains safely with existing logic |\n| Too frequent execution | Increase `IDLE_MIN` and `IDLE_MAX` |\n| Non‑interactive shells | Guard with `[[ $- == *i* ]]` if needed |\n\n---\n\n## **10. Summary**\nThis drop‑in Bash module provides a clean, modular, and dependency‑free way to run tasks during terminal idle time with randomized intervals. It integrates safely with existing shell configurations and supports per‑terminal isolation, making it ideal for lightweight automation, agent loops, and background checks.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also generate:\n\n- a **module loader** for `.bashrc.d/`  \n- a **waif‑style PRD version**  \n- a **beads node spec**  \n- or a **tmux‑aware variant**\n\nJust tell me the direction you want to take it.\n","design":"## Technical Design\n\n[Detailed technical approach]\n\n## API Changes\n\n[New commands, flags, or APIs]\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\n[Database schema changes if any]\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Note 1\n- Note 2\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Unit tests: [scope]\n- Integration tests: [scope]\n- Manual testing: [steps]\n","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Feature implements all described use cases\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Documentation updated (README, commands)\n- [ ] Examples added if applicable\n- [ ] No performance regressions\n","notes":"Documented that the tmux workflow auto-loads the idle scheduler for the PM pane with idle_task(){ clear; waif in-progress; }.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T23:57:36.011092114-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T20:33:27.127557723-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T20:33:27.127563346-08:00","labels":["feature"]}

{"id":"wf-7m7","title":"Add waif command to validate implementation plan integrity","description":"## Feature Request\n\nAdd a new `waif` CLI command that validates the integrity of the current implementation plan (the Beads issue graph + required metadata/policy). The command should catch common plan hygiene errors early and provide actionable, categorized output.\n\nThis is a *plan validator*, not a recommendation engine.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeads gives us a powerful dependency graph, but it’s still easy for a repo’s plan to drift into inconsistent states (e.g., issues marked `in_progress` while still blocked, missing milestone labels, intake artifacts that don’t meet exit criteria, disconnected items that never get executed). A deterministic validator enables:\n\n- Fast feedback after plan edits\n- A reliable preflight before starting work\n- Optional CI gating later\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **PM/Agent hygiene loop**: run after updating issues/deps/labels.\n2. **Preflight**: run before using `waif next` / starting implementation.\n3. **CI guardrail**: fail the build if the plan is inconsistent (optional future).\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Command\n\n- Add `waif plan check` (name bikeshed OK: `waif plan-check`, `waif check-plan`)\n- Output formats:\n  - Default: human readable Markdown report\n  - `--json`: machine-readable JSON report with stable schema\n\n### Data sources\n\n- Prefer `bd` when available.\n  - Use `bd list --json` (status-filtered) to build the candidate universe.\n  - Use `bd show \u003cids\u003e --json` in chunks to fetch dependency details and labels where needed.\n- Fallback: parse `.beads/issues.jsonl` when `bd` is unavailable (consistent with `waif next`).\n\n### Validation categories (minimum)\n\n1) **In-progress/closed but blocked by non-closed**\n- Flag issues where:\n  - `status` is `in_progress` OR `closed`\n  - and the issue has one or more `blocks` dependencies whose target issue status is *not terminal*.\n- Terminal statuses should include at least: `closed`, `done`, `tombstone`.\n- Report should include the blocking dependency IDs (and their statuses).\n\n2) **Missing milestone label**\n- Flag issues that are part of the execution plan but do not have a milestone label.\n- Initial policy (tunable):\n  - If an issue has any dependency edge OR any dependent edge OR a `parent` relationship, it must have at least one label matching `milestone:M*`.\n\n3) **Does not meet intake exit criteria**\n- Flag issues that are considered actionable work but do not meet the exit criteria implied by `.opencode/command/intake.md`.\n- Initial, deterministic checks (derived from the intake template requirements):\n  - Issue must have a non-empty `title`.\n  - Issue must have a non-empty `description` containing the required sections (string match is OK):\n    - `- Problem`\n    - `- Users`\n    - `- Success criteria`\n    - `- Constraints`\n    - `- Clarifying questions`\n    - `- Proposed next step`\n  - (Optional strict mode later) If `Proposed next step` indicates `NEW PRD` or `UPDATE PRD`, validate the referenced path exists.\n\n4) **Orphaned issues**\n- Flag issues that appear unintentionally disconnected from the plan:\n  - no dependencies\n  - no dependents\n  - no parent relationship\n- Report should include a short suggestion for how to resolve (add parent, add deps, or explicitly label as standalone).\n\n### Report requirements\n\nHuman output (Markdown):\n\n- `# Plan Integrity Report`\n- `## Summary` with counts for each category and an overall exit status.\n- One section per category with a clear list/table of offending issues.\n- A short `## Fix Guidance` section with suggested `bd` commands/patterns.\n\nJSON output:\n\n- Top-level fields:\n  - `ok: boolean`\n  - `summary: { \u003ccategoryKey\u003e: number, total: number }`\n  - `categories: { \u003ccategoryKey\u003e: Array\u003c...\u003e }`\n- Each category entry must include at least:\n  - `id`, `title`, `status`, `priority`, `labels`\n  - and category-specific metadata (e.g., `blockingDeps`, `missingSections`, `reason`).\n\nExit codes:\n\n- Exit code `0`: no findings.\n- Exit code `1`: findings exist.\n- Exit code `2`: command/config error (e.g., cannot read issues).\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Scope: what is the canonical “implementation plan” universe?\n  - All issues in `.beads/issues.jsonl`?\n  - Only issues reachable from a configured root epic (e.g., `wf-ba2`)?\n  - Only issues with specific labels (e.g., `prd-agent`)?\n\n- Milestone policy: should milestone labels be required for *all* plan-connected issues, or only for leaf tasks/features?\n\n- Intake checks:\n  - Should we require the exact intake template headings, or allow other formats (heuristic detection)?\n  - Is the source of truth `.opencode/command/intake.md` (current), or should we codify repo-specific criteria elsewhere?\n\n- Orphans:\n  - Are top-level epics with no deps/dependents considered valid roots, or should they be flagged unless explicitly marked?\n\n- Additional integrity checks to consider (not required for v1):\n  - Dependency cycles (optionally leverage `bv --robot-insights` when available)\n  - Dependencies referencing missing IDs\n  - Status outside the known set (open/in_progress/closed/done/tombstone)\n  - Priority missing/out of range\n  - Parent/child inconsistencies (parent missing;

Provide the same command surface (`pm`, `pm prd`) and UX primitives (help, `--json`, `--verbose`, exit codes), keeping behavior stubby but ready for M0 follow-on work.\n\n## Goals\n- Deliver a TypeScript entrypoint `pm` runnable via npm/yarn/pnpm (`npx pm` and installed binary).\n- Keep the initial subcommand surface identical: `pm prd --out \u003cpath\u003e [--json] [--verbose]`.\n- Establish shared CLI scaffolding: command registration, result/JSON emission, error/exit-code mapping, and verbose logging.\n- Generate a stub PRD file to prove FS write path end-to-end.\n\n## Non-goals\n- Real PRD generation or prompt ingestion (follow-on issues).\n- TUI/interactive flows.\n- Telemetry/auth/config persistence.\n\n## Architecture\n- **Language/Tooling**: TypeScript targeting Node 18+, built with `ts-node`/`tsx` for dev; bundled to a dist folder via `tsc` for publish.\n- **CLI framework**: Commander (lightweight, battle-tested, good help UX). Alternative acceptable: oclif; prefer Commander for minimal footprint.\n- **Project layout**:\n  - `src/index.ts`: bootstraps Commander program, registers subcommands, exports `run()` for tests.\n  - `src/commands/prd.ts`: implements `prd` subcommand.\n  - `src/lib/io.ts`: small helpers for stdout/stderr writes (human vs JSON), structured error typing, exit-code mapping.\n  - `src/types.ts`: shared result/error shapes.\n- **Packaging**:\n  - `package.json` with `bin: { \"pm\": \"./dist/index.js\" }`.\n  - Scripts: `build` (tsc), `start` (tsx src/index.ts), `lint` (optional), `test` (vitest or jest; prefer `vitest` for speed/TS-native).\n  - Type definitions emitted to `dist/` alongside JS for consumers/tests.\n\n## CLI Surface \u0026 Behavior\n- Root: `pm`\n  - Global flags recognized on root and subcommands: `--json`, `--verbose`, `--version`, `--help` (Commander standard).\n- Subcommand: `pm prd --out \u003cpath\u003e`\n  - Validates `--out` presence; usage errors exit with code 2.\n  - Creates parent directories if missing.\n  - Writes stub Markdown with a heading and placeholder sections (e.g., Title, Summary, Requirements).\n  - Success output:\n    - Human: `Wrote PRD stub to \u003cresolvedPath\u003e` to stdout.\n    - JSON: `{ \"out\": \"\u003cresolvedPath\u003e\", \"stub\": true }` to stdout.\n  - Verbose: emit diagnostics to stderr (resolved path, write start/end).\n\n## Error Handling \u0026 Exit Codes\n- Exit codes: `0` success; `1` controlled operational error; `2` usage/parse error (Commander default for missing required options).\n- Controlled errors (e.g., unwritable path) throw typed `CliError` with `exitCode` and `message`; handler maps to exit and stderr, respecting `--json` by emitting `{ error: { message, code } }` to stdout.\n- Unexpected exceptions fall back to exit `1` with a terse message.\n\n## Testing Plan (Node/TS)\n- Unit/CLI tests with `vitest` + `execa` (or `node:test` + `child_process`) against the built CLI:\n  - `pm --help` shows `prd`.\n  - `pm prd --help` works.\n  - Missing `--out` -\u003e exit 2.\n  - Success write to temp file -\u003e exit 0 and file contents include stub header.\n  - JSON mode emits valid JSON with `stub: true`.\n  - Unwritable path -\u003e exit 1 with actionable message.\n- Optional: snapshot stub content to keep structure stable.\n\n## Migration Notes (from Python scaffold)\n- Maintain the same command names and flag semantics to avoid breaking dependents.\n- Replace Typer-specific behaviors with Commander equivalents; keep exit codes aligned (2 for parse errors, 1 for operational errors).\n- Provide npm/yarn install instructions; drop Python-specific install steps.\n- Consider a thin compatibility note in README once implementation lands.","notes":"Added a mandatory dirty-working-tree decision gate to docs (.opencode/command/implement.md + docs/Workflow.md).

Should the CLI always run in “instruction emission” mode (prints `/prd ...`) vs attempting to spawn an interactive OpenCode session?\n  3.

{"id":"wf-ca1","title":"Beads evaluation tasks: Intake brief","description":"- Problem\n  - This repo (WAFI) needed an initial evaluation of using Beads (`bd` + optional `bv`) as the single source of truth for issue tracking, and guidance for agents so planning doesn't drift into TODO lists or external trackers.\n  - The immediate problem was that workflow/PRD documents referenced a Beads evaluation workstream (wf-ca1), but the issue itself had no description, making the reference confusing and leaving wf-ba2 shown as blocked.\n\n- Users\n  - Primary: a single PM working inside the git repo using the WAFI CLI + OpenCode.\n  - Secondary: coding/doc agents operating via the same repo-first workflow; future TUI users.\n\n- Success criteria\n  - wf-ca1 clearly explains what it tracked and what artifacts resulted.\n  - References in docs point to concrete repo artifacts (PRDs/workflow guidance) and/or successor issues.\n  - Closing wf-ca1 should not leave wf-ba2 blocked by an undefined item.\n\n- Constraints\n  - Beads (`bd`) remains canonical for all issue tracking.\n  - Workflow artifacts live in-repo (primarily `docs/`); no duplicate task lists.\n  - Keep the change minimal: document and close the missing issue rather than inventing new scope.\n\n- Existing state (if applicable)\n  - `wf-ca1` existed as an open epic, with an empty description.\n  - Most historical wf-ca1.* evaluation subtasks were tombstoned during a cleanup.\n  - The learnings/requirements are already captured in repo docs (see below).\n\n- Desired change (if applicable)\n  - Document wf-ca1 as the intake/evaluation brief that led to:\n    - Beads-first workflow guidance in `AGENTS.md`.\n    - Product requirements referencing Beads usage in `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` and `docs/Workflow.md`.\n  - Close wf-ca1 as completed to avoid being an unexplained blocker.\n\n- Likely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\n  - `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n  - `docs/Workflow.md`\n  - `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n  - `AGENTS.md`\n  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`\n\n- Related issues (Beads ids)\n  - `wf-dt1` (Evaluate beads for issue tracking) (closed)\n  - `wf-ba2` (PM Agent MVP) (in_progress; originally blocked by wf-ca1)\n  - `wf-t31` (Add template usage guidance to bd onboard output) (open)\n\n- Clarifying questions\n  1. Should wf-ba2 keep an explicit dependency edge to wf-ca1 now that wf-ca1 is closed, or should the dependency be removed for clarity?\n  2. Do we want a dedicated issue (or epic) for ongoing Beads workflow evolution, separate from the initial evaluation?\n  3. Should the doc cross-references continue pointing at wf-ca1, or be updated to reference wf-dt1 (or another successor) instead?\n\n- Proposed next step:\n  - UPDATE PRD at: `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` (only if we want to change cross-references away from wf-ca1)\n  - Recommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md wf-ca1`\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-18T13:12:40.598302523-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T11:21:19.802456129-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T11:21:19.802456129-08:00","close_reason":"Completed: documented and resolved undefined wf-ca1 blocker","labels":["Chore"]}

{"id":"wf-lp0","title":"waif ask: one-shot CLI agent query","description":"Problem\n\nSometimes we just want a quick, one-shot answer from an agent without starting an interactive CLI/TUI session. We need a `waif ask` command that accepts a prompt, sends it to an agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allows optionally prefixing the prompt with an agent name (e.g. `ask patch ...`), and returns the agent's response to the console in Markdown (or `--json`) with no session tracking (one-shot MVP).\n\nUsers\n\nPrimary: producers who need fast, ad-hoc answers in the terminal (PMs/engineers writing prompts).\nSecondary: CLI users and automation that may call `waif ask` from scripts; QA and docs teams who rely on predictable one-shot outputs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nMVP success is that a user can run `waif ask \"\u003cprompt\u003e\"` and receive a coherent agent response rendered as Markdown to the console (or machine-readable JSON when `--json` is passed). The UX/implementation goal: ask -\u003e get response (no session), responses are stable Markdown and usable in pipelines.\n\nConstraints\n\nNo timeline or special constraints were specified. No session tracking or state persistence in MVP. Default agent is `Map` (PM); agent override via prefixing the prompt is required. No privacy/security constraints specified by requester.\n\nExisting state\n\n- The CLI contains a PRD/CLI design effort (`docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`) and PRD-agent wiring work (`wf-ba2.3.6`, `wf-ba2.3.1`) that overlap with PRD generation and OpenCode integration. There is not a dedicated `waif ask` command implemented today.\n\nDesired change\n\nAdd a new `waif ask` CLI command that:\n- Accepts a prompt string or reads from stdin\n- Sends the prompt to a chosen agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allowing an agent name prefix to override\n- Returns the agent's response to stdout rendered as Markdown, or `--json` for machine output\n- Is one-shot only (no session persistence)\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (intake/PRD workflow)\n- `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/implemented/find_next_PRD.md`\n\nRelated issues\n\n- `wf-ba2.3.1` - Minimal PRD generator (writes Markdown file)\n- `wf-ba2.3.6` - Wire waif prd command to PRD Agent workflow\n- `wf-ba2.3` - PRD Template \u0026 Validation (epic)\n- `wf-7m7` - Add waif command to validate implementation plan integrity (related CLI expansion)\n- `wf-soh` - Integrate marked-terminal markdown rendering for all CLI output (rendering pipeline)\n\nClarifying questions\n\n1. Confirm default agent: should `Map` (PM) be the default for `waif ask`?  \n2. Which output modes are required beyond `--json` and rendered Markdown (e.g., raw text, exit codes for partial failures)?  \n3. Should `waif ask` support reading prompts from stdin or files for scripting?  \n4. Is any prompt auditing/logging required (even minimal), or must MVP avoid writing prompts anywhere?  \n5. Are there agent name parsing rules (single token prefix vs multiple-word agent names)?\n\nProposed next step\n\nNEW PRD at: `docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md`\nRecommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md \u003cissue-id\u003e`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-21T00:51:49.358764386-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T13:57:27.63998396-08:00"}

{"id":"wf-t31","title":"Add template usage guidance to bd onboard output","description":"## Feature Request\n\nUpdate the `bd onboard` command output to include guidance on when and how AI agents should use templates when creating issues.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, `bd onboard` provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents but doesn't mention the template system. This leads to AI agents creating minimal issues without the structured documentation that templates provide. Adding template guidance would:\n\n1. Improve issue quality by encouraging use of structured templates\n2. Ensure bugs include reproduction steps and environment details\n3. Ensure features capture design decisions and alternatives considered\n4. Maintain consistency across issues created by different AI agents\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **AI Agent Onboarding**: When a new AI agent runs `bd onboard`, it learns to use templates for bugs, features, and epics automatically\n2. **Existing Projects**: Teams can regenerate AGENTS.md with updated best practices by re-running `bd onboard`\n3. **Documentation Consistency**: All projects using beads get consistent, high-quality issue documentation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify the `bd onboard` command output in two places:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md content**: Update the \"Create new issues\" section to show template usage:\n   ```bash\n   # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n   bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n   bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Templates section** after \"MCP Server\" section with:\n   - List of available templates (bug, feature, epic)\n   - When to use each template\n   - When to skip templates (tasks/chores)\n   - Template viewing commands\n\n3. **Update Important Rules** to include: \"Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\"\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Add template suggestions to `bd create` command itself (e.g., prompt \"Use --from-template?\")\n  - Why not chosen: Too intrusive for human users who may prefer quick issue creation\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Create separate `bd onboard --with-templates` flag\n  - Why not chosen: Splits the onboarding experience; templates should be default best practice","design":"## Technical Design\n\nThe `bd onboard` command outputs hardcoded markdown strings. This feature requires updating the string constants in the Go source code.\n\n**File to modify**: `cmd/onboard.go` (or similar in beads source)\n\n**Changes needed**:\n1. Update AGENTS.md template string to include template examples in \"Create new issues\" section\n2. Add new \"Templates\" section after \"MCP Server\" section\n3. Update \"Important Rules\" to include template usage guideline\n4. Similarly update the .github/copilot-instructions.md template string\n\n## API Changes\n\nNo API changes - only updates to string constants in `bd onboard` output.\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\nNo database schema changes required.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The exact file location may vary (likely in `cmd/` directory)\n- Both AGENTS.md and copilot-instructions.md templates need updates\n- Keep changes minimal - just add template guidance to existing structure\n- Match existing formatting and style conventions\n- Test by running `bd onboard` and verifying output\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- **Manual testing**: \n  1. Run `bd onboard` in a test directory\n  2. Verify AGENTS.md includes template examples\n  3. Verify Templates section is present with correct content\n  4. Verify Important Rules includes template guidance\n  5.

{"id":"wf-udv","title":"waif ask: Intake brief","description":"Problem\n\nSometimes we just want a quick, one-shot answer from an agent without starting an interactive CLI/TUI session. We need a `waif ask` command that accepts a prompt, sends it to an agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allows optionally prefixing the prompt with an agent name (e.g. `ask patch ...`), and returns the agent's response to the console in Markdown (or `--json`) with no session tracking (one-shot MVP).\n\nUsers\n\nPrimary: producers who need fast, ad-hoc answers in the terminal (PMs/engineers writing prompts).\nSecondary: CLI users and automation that may call `waif ask` from scripts; QA and docs teams who rely on predictable one-shot outputs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nMVP success is that a user can run `waif ask \"\u003cprompt\u003e\"` and receive a coherent agent response rendered as Markdown to the console (or machine-readable JSON when `--json` is passed). The UX/implementation goal: ask -\u003e get response (no session), responses are stable Markdown and usable in pipelines.\n\nConstraints\n\nNo timeline or special constraints were specified. No session tracking or state persistence in MVP. Default agent is `Map` (PM); agent override via prefixing the prompt is required. No privacy/security constraints specified by requester.\n\nExisting state\n\n- The CLI contains a PRD/CLI design effort (`docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`) and PRD-agent wiring work (`wf-ba2.3.6`, `wf-ba2.3.1`) that overlap with PRD generation and OpenCode integration. There is not a dedicated `waif ask` command implemented today.\n\nDesired change\n\nAdd a new `waif ask` CLI command that:\n- Accepts a prompt string or reads from stdin\n- Sends the prompt to a chosen agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allowing an agent name prefix to override\n- Returns the agent's response to stdout rendered as Markdown, or `--json` for machine output\n- Is one-shot only (no session persistence)\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (intake/PRD workflow)\n- `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/implemented/find_next_PRD.md`\n\nRelated issues\n\n- `wf-ba2.3.1` - Minimal PRD generator (writes Markdown file)\n- `wf-ba2.3.6` - Wire waif prd command to PRD Agent workflow\n- `wf-ba2.3` - PRD Template \u0026 Validation (epic)\n- `wf-7m7` - Add waif command to validate implementation plan integrity (related CLI expansion)\n- `wf-soh` - Integrate marked-terminal markdown rendering for all CLI output (rendering pipeline)\n\nClarifying questions\n\n1. Confirm default agent: should `Map` (PM) be the default for `waif ask`?  \n2. Which output modes are required beyond `--json` and rendered Markdown (e.g., raw text, exit codes for partial failures)?  \n3. Should `waif ask` support reading prompts from stdin or files for scripting?  \n4. Is any prompt auditing/logging required (even minimal), or must MVP avoid writing prompts anywhere?  \n5. Are there agent name parsing rules (single token prefix vs multiple-word agent names)?\n\nProposed next step\n\nNEW PRD at: `docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md`\nRecommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md \u003cissue-id\u003e`","notes":"OpenCode wiring added; enable with OPENCODE_ENABLED=1 and install OpenCode SDK.
