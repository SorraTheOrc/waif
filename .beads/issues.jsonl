{"id":"wf-58w","title":"Build countdown timer application with Agent Mail integration","description":"## Feature Request\n\nBuild a real-world countdown timer application that demonstrates Agent Mail integration for cross-agent communication and coordination.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAgent Mail (https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) is an MCP server that enables AI agents to communicate asynchronously via a message queue system. Building a countdown timer application serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. **Learn Agent Mail**: Practical experience with MCP-based agent communication\n2. **Real Application**: Create a useful tool (multiple timers with alarms)\n3. **Demonstrate Coordination**: Show how agents can coordinate on building a complete application\n4. **Test Workflow**: Exercise beads issue tracking in a realistic development scenario\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Multiple Timers**: User can create multiple countdown timers running simultaneously\n2. **Timer Management**: Start, pause, resume, cancel, and reset individual timers\n3. **Visual Display**: Show remaining time for all active timers\n4. **Audio Alarms**: Sound notification when timer completes\n5. **Persistent State**: Save timer state so they survive application restart\n6. **Agent Coordination**: Use Agent Mail for agents to coordinate implementation tasks\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a terminal-based countdown timer application with:\n\n**Technology Stack**:\n- Python or Node.js for the application\n- Agent Mail MCP server for agent-to-agent communication\n- Sound library for alarms (e.g., playsound, beep, or system notification)\n- Simple TUI or CLI interface\n- JSON file for persistence\n\n**Agent Mail Usage**:\n- Coordinate development tasks between multiple AI agents\n- Use message queues to assign subtasks (UI, timer logic, alarm system, etc.)\n- Demonstrate asynchronous agent communication patterns\n\n**Features**:\n- `timer add \u003cname\u003e \u003cduration\u003e` - Create new timer (e.g., \"5m\", \"2h30m\")\n- `timer list` - Show all active timers\n- `timer pause \u003cname\u003e` - Pause a timer\n- `timer resume \u003cname\u003e` - Resume a paused timer\n- `timer cancel \u003cname\u003e` - Cancel a timer\n- `timer reset \u003cname\u003e` - Reset timer to original duration\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Build a web-based timer with real-time updates\n  - Why not chosen: More complex, focus should be on Agent Mail integration not web development\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Simple single-timer application\n  - Why not chosen: Too basic, doesn't showcase agent coordination or complex state management\n  \n- **Alternative 3**: Pomodoro timer specific\n  - Why not chosen: Less flexible than general countdown timers","design":"## Technical Design\n\n[Detailed technical approach]\n\n## API Changes\n\n[New commands, flags, or APIs]\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\n[Database schema changes if any]\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Note 1\n- Note 2\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Unit tests: [scope]\n- Integration tests: [scope]\n- Manual testing: [steps]\n","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Application can create and manage multiple countdown timers simultaneously\n- [ ] Timers support common duration formats (5m, 2h30m, 90s)\n- [ ] Audio alarm sounds when timer completes\n- [ ] Timer state persists across application restarts\n- [ ] All CLI commands (add, list, pause, resume, cancel, reset) work correctly\n- [ ] Agent Mail MCP server successfully coordinates agent tasks\n- [ ] Documentation includes Agent Mail setup and usage examples\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms all features work end-to-end","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-16T12:51:31.969126204-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T13:45:05.826156917-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["application","feature"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"wf-58w","depends_on_id":"wf-dt1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T16:41:23.490283632-08:00","created_by":"rogardle"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-18T13:45:05.826156917-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

Provide the same command surface (`pm`, `pm prd`) and UX primitives (help, `--json`, `--verbose`, exit codes), keeping behavior stubby but ready for M0 follow-on work.\n\n## Goals\n- Deliver a TypeScript entrypoint `pm` runnable via npm/yarn/pnpm (`npx pm` and installed binary).\n- Keep the initial subcommand surface identical: `pm prd --out \u003cpath\u003e [--json] [--verbose]`.\n- Establish shared CLI scaffolding: command registration, result/JSON emission, error/exit-code mapping, and verbose logging.\n- Generate a stub PRD file to prove FS write path end-to-end.\n\n## Non-goals\n- Real PRD generation or prompt ingestion (follow-on issues).\n- TUI/interactive flows.\n- Telemetry/auth/config persistence.\n\n## Architecture\n- **Language/Tooling**: TypeScript targeting Node 18+, built with `ts-node`/`tsx` for dev; bundled to a dist folder via `tsc` for publish.\n- **CLI framework**: Commander (lightweight, battle-tested, good help UX). Alternative acceptable: oclif; prefer Commander for minimal footprint.\n- **Project layout**:\n  - `src/index.ts`: bootstraps Commander program, registers subcommands, exports `run()` for tests.\n  - `src/commands/prd.ts`: implements `prd` subcommand.\n  - `src/lib/io.ts`: small helpers for stdout/stderr writes (human vs JSON), structured error typing, exit-code mapping.\n  - `src/types.ts`: shared result/error shapes.\n- **Packaging**:\n  - `package.json` with `bin: { \"pm\": \"./dist/index.js\" }`.\n  - Scripts: `build` (tsc), `start` (tsx src/index.ts), `lint` (optional), `test` (vitest or jest; prefer `vitest` for speed/TS-native).\n  - Type definitions emitted to `dist/` alongside JS for consumers/tests.\n\n## CLI Surface \u0026 Behavior\n- Root: `pm`\n  - Global flags recognized on root and subcommands: `--json`, `--verbose`, `--version`, `--help` (Commander standard).\n- Subcommand: `pm prd --out \u003cpath\u003e`\n  - Validates `--out` presence; usage errors exit with code 2.\n  - Creates parent directories if missing.\n  - Writes stub Markdown with a heading and placeholder sections (e.g., Title, Summary, Requirements).\n  - Success output:\n    - Human: `Wrote PRD stub to \u003cresolvedPath\u003e` to stdout.\n    - JSON: `{ \"out\": \"\u003cresolvedPath\u003e\", \"stub\": true }` to stdout.\n  - Verbose: emit diagnostics to stderr (resolved path, write start/end).\n\n## Error Handling \u0026 Exit Codes\n- Exit codes: `0` success; `1` controlled operational error; `2` usage/parse error (Commander default for missing required options).\n- Controlled errors (e.g., unwritable path) throw typed `CliError` with `exitCode` and `message`; handler maps to exit and stderr, respecting `--json` by emitting `{ error: { message, code } }` to stdout.\n- Unexpected exceptions fall back to exit `1` with a terse message.\n\n## Testing Plan (Node/TS)\n- Unit/CLI tests with `vitest` + `execa` (or `node:test` + `child_process`) against the built CLI:\n  - `pm --help` shows `prd`.\n  - `pm prd --help` works.\n  - Missing `--out` -\u003e exit 2.\n  - Success write to temp file -\u003e exit 0 and file contents include stub header.\n  - JSON mode emits valid JSON with `stub: true`.\n  - Unwritable path -\u003e exit 1 with actionable message.\n- Optional: snapshot stub content to keep structure stable.\n\n## Migration Notes (from Python scaffold)\n- Maintain the same command names and flag semantics to avoid breaking dependents.\n- Replace Typer-specific behaviors with Commander equivalents; keep exit codes aligned (2 for parse errors, 1 for operational errors).\n- Provide npm/yarn install instructions; drop Python-specific install steps.\n- Consider a thin compatibility note in README once implementation lands.","notes":"Added a mandatory dirty-working-tree decision gate to docs (.opencode/command/implement.md + docs/Workflow.md).

{"id":"wf-ca1","title":"Beads evaluation tasks: Intake brief","description":"- Problem\n  - This repo (WAFI) needed an initial evaluation of using Beads (`bd` + optional `bv`) as the single source of truth for issue tracking, and guidance for agents so planning doesn't drift into TODO lists or external trackers.\n  - The immediate problem was that workflow/PRD documents referenced a Beads evaluation workstream (wf-ca1), but the issue itself had no description, making the reference confusing and leaving wf-ba2 shown as blocked.\n\n- Users\n  - Primary: a single PM working inside the git repo using the WAFI CLI + OpenCode.\n  - Secondary: coding/doc agents operating via the same repo-first workflow; future TUI users.\n\n- Success criteria\n  - wf-ca1 clearly explains what it tracked and what artifacts resulted.\n  - References in docs point to concrete repo artifacts (PRDs/workflow guidance) and/or successor issues.\n  - Closing wf-ca1 should not leave wf-ba2 blocked by an undefined item.\n\n- Constraints\n  - Beads (`bd`) remains canonical for all issue tracking.\n  - Workflow artifacts live in-repo (primarily `docs/`); no duplicate task lists.\n  - Keep the change minimal: document and close the missing issue rather than inventing new scope.\n\n- Existing state (if applicable)\n  - `wf-ca1` existed as an open epic, with an empty description.\n  - Most historical wf-ca1.* evaluation subtasks were tombstoned during a cleanup.\n  - The learnings/requirements are already captured in repo docs (see below).\n\n- Desired change (if applicable)\n  - Document wf-ca1 as the intake/evaluation brief that led to:\n    - Beads-first workflow guidance in `AGENTS.md`.\n    - Product requirements referencing Beads usage in `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` and `docs/Workflow.md`.\n  - Close wf-ca1 as completed to avoid being an unexplained blocker.\n\n- Likely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\n  - `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n  - `docs/Workflow.md`\n  - `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n  - `AGENTS.md`\n  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`\n\n- Related issues (Beads ids)\n  - `wf-dt1` (Evaluate beads for issue tracking) (closed)\n  - `wf-ba2` (PM Agent MVP) (in_progress; originally blocked by wf-ca1)\n  - `wf-t31` (Add template usage guidance to bd onboard output) (open)\n\n- Clarifying questions\n  1. Should wf-ba2 keep an explicit dependency edge to wf-ca1 now that wf-ca1 is closed, or should the dependency be removed for clarity?\n  2.

{"id":"wf-t31","title":"Add template usage guidance to bd onboard output","description":"## Feature Request\n\nUpdate the `bd onboard` command output to include guidance on when and how AI agents should use templates when creating issues.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, `bd onboard` provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents but doesn't mention the template system. This leads to AI agents creating minimal issues without the structured documentation that templates provide. Adding template guidance would:\n\n1. Improve issue quality by encouraging use of structured templates\n2. Ensure bugs include reproduction steps and environment details\n3. Ensure features capture design decisions and alternatives considered\n4. Maintain consistency across issues created by different AI agents\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **AI Agent Onboarding**: When a new AI agent runs `bd onboard`, it learns to use templates for bugs, features, and epics automatically\n2. **Existing Projects**: Teams can regenerate AGENTS.md with updated best practices by re-running `bd onboard`\n3. **Documentation Consistency**: All projects using beads get consistent, high-quality issue documentation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify the `bd onboard` command output in two places:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md content**: Update the \"Create new issues\" section to show template usage:\n   ```bash\n   # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n   bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n   bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Templates section** after \"MCP Server\" section with:\n   - List of available templates (bug, feature, epic)\n   - When to use each template\n   - When to skip templates (tasks/chores)\n   - Template viewing commands\n\n3. **Update Important Rules** to include: \"Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\"\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Add template suggestions to `bd create` command itself (e.g., prompt \"Use --from-template?\")\n  - Why not chosen: Too intrusive for human users who may prefer quick issue creation\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Create separate `bd onboard --with-templates` flag\n  - Why not chosen: Splits the onboarding experience; templates should be default best practice","design":"## Technical Design\n\nThe `bd onboard` command outputs hardcoded markdown strings. This feature requires updating the string constants in the Go source code.\n\n**File to modify**: `cmd/onboard.go` (or similar in beads source)\n\n**Changes needed**:\n1. Update AGENTS.md template string to include template examples in \"Create new issues\" section\n2. Add new \"Templates\" section after \"MCP Server\" section\n3. Update \"Important Rules\" to include template usage guideline\n4. Similarly update the .github/copilot-instructions.md template string\n\n## API Changes\n\nNo API changes - only updates to string constants in `bd onboard` output.\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\nNo database schema changes required.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The exact file location may vary (likely in `cmd/` directory)\n- Both AGENTS.md and copilot-instructions.md templates need updates\n- Keep changes minimal - just add template guidance to existing structure\n- Match existing formatting and style conventions\n- Test by running `bd onboard` and verifying output\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- **Manual testing**: \n  1. Run `bd onboard` in a test directory\n  2. Verify AGENTS.md includes template examples\n  3. Verify Templates section is present with correct content\n  4. Verify Important Rules includes template guidance\n  5. Check copilot-instructions.md similarly\n  \n- **Integration tests**: Add test case that parses `bd onboard` output and verifies template sections exist\n  \n- **Regression testing**: Ensure existing onboard functionality remains unchanged (file creation, directory structure)","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] `bd onboard` output includes template usage examples in 'Create new issues' section\n- [ ] New 'Templates' section is added to AGENTS.md template with complete guidance\n- [ ] 'Important Rules' section includes template usage guideline\n- [ ] .github/copilot-instructions.md template similarly updated with template guidance\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms correct output in new projects\n- [ ] Existing `bd onboard` tests pass without modification\n- [ ] Documentation (if any) about `bd onboard` is updated to mention templates\n- [ ] Changes submitted as PR to beads upstream repository","notes":"Reference implementation: This project's AGENTS.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md files contain the exact changes needed.\n\nUpstream repo: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\n\nNext steps:\n1.
