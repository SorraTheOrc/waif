{"id":"beads-testing-58w","title":"Build countdown timer application with Agent Mail integration","description":"## Feature Request\n\nBuild a real-world countdown timer application that demonstrates Agent Mail integration for cross-agent communication and coordination.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAgent Mail (https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) is an MCP server that enables AI agents to communicate asynchronously via a message queue system. Building a countdown timer application serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. **Learn Agent Mail**: Practical experience with MCP-based agent communication\n2. **Real Application**: Create a useful tool (multiple timers with alarms)\n3. **Demonstrate Coordination**: Show how agents can coordinate on building a complete application\n4. **Test Workflow**: Exercise beads issue tracking in a realistic development scenario\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Multiple Timers**: User can create multiple countdown timers running simultaneously\n2. **Timer Management**: Start, pause, resume, cancel, and reset individual timers\n3. **Visual Display**: Show remaining time for all active timers\n4. **Audio Alarms**: Sound notification when timer completes\n5. **Persistent State**: Save timer state so they survive application restart\n6. **Agent Coordination**: Use Agent Mail for agents to coordinate implementation tasks\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a terminal-based countdown timer application with:\n\n**Technology Stack**:\n- Python or Node.js for the application\n- Agent Mail MCP server for agent-to-agent communication\n- Sound library for alarms (e.g., playsound, beep, or system notification)\n- Simple TUI or CLI interface\n- JSON file for persistence\n\n**Agent Mail Usage**:\n- Coordinate development tasks between multiple AI agents\n- Use message queues to assign subtasks (UI, timer logic, alarm system, etc.)\n- Demonstrate asynchronous agent communication patterns\n\n**Features**:\n- `timer add \u003cname\u003e \u003cduration\u003e` - Create new timer (e.g., \"5m\", \"2h30m\")\n- `timer list` - Show all active timers\n- `timer pause \u003cname\u003e` - Pause a timer\n- `timer resume \u003cname\u003e` - Resume a paused timer\n- `timer cancel \u003cname\u003e` - Cancel a timer\n- `timer reset \u003cname\u003e` - Reset timer to original duration\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Build a web-based timer with real-time updates\n  - Why not chosen: More complex, focus should be on Agent Mail integration not web development\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Simple single-timer application\n  - Why not chosen: Too basic, doesn't showcase agent coordination or complex state management\n  \n- **Alternative 3**: Pomodoro timer specific\n  - Why not chosen: Less flexible than general countdown timers","design":"## Technical Design\n\n[Detailed technical approach]\n\n## API Changes\n\n[New commands, flags, or APIs]\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\n[Database schema changes if any]\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Note 1\n- Note 2\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Unit tests: [scope]\n- Integration tests: [scope]\n- Manual testing: [steps]\n","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Application can create and manage multiple countdown timers simultaneously\n- [ ] Timers support common duration formats (5m, 2h30m, 90s)\n- [ ] Audio alarm sounds when timer completes\n- [ ] Timer state persists across application restarts\n- [ ] All CLI commands (add, list, pause, resume, cancel, reset) work correctly\n- [ ] Agent Mail MCP server successfully coordinates agent tasks\n- [ ] Documentation includes Agent Mail setup and usage examples\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms all features work end-to-end","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-16T12:51:31.969126204-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T10:19:32.741497906-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T10:19:32.741497906-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["application","feature"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"beads-testing-58w","depends_on_id":"beads-testing-dt1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T16:41:23.490283632-08:00","created_by":"rogardle"}]}

{"id":"beads-testing-ba2.2.1","title":"CLI skeleton + subcommands scaffold","description":"M0: Provide CLI entrypoint and minimal subcommands.","design":"# Design\n\n## Summary\nScaffold a runnable **Python** CLI entrypoint (command: `pm`) using **Typer** with a minimal set of subcommands that other M0 tasks can build on (prompt input, PRD generation, etc.). This issue focuses on wiring, command layout, and consistent UX primitives (help text, exit codes), not on implementing the full functionality behind each command.\n\n## Goals\n- Provide a single CLI entrypoint runnable by users: `pm`.\n- Define the initial subcommand surface needed for M0 follow-on tasks (notably `pm prd`).\n- Establish consistent CLI UX: `--help`, argument parsing, exit codes, and error messages.\n- Create a scaffold that is easy to extend without breaking existing commands.\n\n## Non-goals\n- Implementing full downstream features (e.g., high-quality PRD generation, linting, branch/PR creation).\n- Building a TUI.\n- Adding complex configuration, auth, telemetry, or persistent storage not required for a runnable scaffold.\n\n## Architecture\n- Use **Typer** for CLI parsing and help text.\n- Entry module provides a Typer `app` and registers subcommands.\n- Each subcommand is implemented in its own module/file with:\n  - flag/arg definitions\n  - a handler that returns a typed result or raises a controlled `CliError`\n  - minimal IO boundaries (stdout/stderr/filesystem)\n- Shared CLI utilities module for:\n  - printing (stdout vs stderr)\n  - exit code mapping\n  - global flags implemented consistently across commands (`--json`, `--verbose`)\n\n## Data Model\n- No new persistent data required for the skeleton.\n- In-memory structures:\n  - parsed CLI state for each command (Typer parameters)\n  - a `CliError` (or similar) exception type with fields like `message`, `exit_code`, and optional `details`\n  - a small result payload shape for machine output when `--json` is set\n\n## API / CLI Changes\nCommand surface:\n- Root command: `pm`\n  - `--help`, `--version`\n  - global flags:\n    - `--json`: emit machine-readable output where applicable\n    - `--verbose`: emit debug diagnostics to stderr\n- Subcommands (minimum for this issue):\n  - `pm prd --out \u003cpath\u003e`\n\n`pm prd` contract for this scaffold (stub behavior is OK):\n- Requires `--out \u003cpath\u003e`.\n- Writes a stub Markdown file to `--out` to prove end-to-end “CLI -\u003e filesystem write” wiring.\n  - Stub should be valid Markdown (e.g., a heading + minimal sections).\n- Prints a success message to stdout (and if `--json` is set, prints JSON instead).\n\nNotes:\n- Follow-on issue `ba2.2.2` defines precise prompt input modes for `pm prd` (arg/stdin/file) and how prompt content populates the PRD.\n- Follow-on issue `ba2.3.1` defines the real PRD content generation behavior.\n\n## UX / TUI Changes\n- CLI only.\n- stdout:\n  - human mode: concise success messages (e.g., “Wrote PRD stub to \u003cpath\u003e”)\n  - `--json` mode: JSON object describing what happened (at minimum: `{\"out\": \"...\", \"stub\": true}`)\n- stderr:\n  - errors and diagnostics\n  - verbose logs when `--verbose` is set\n\n## Error Handling\n- Standardize exit codes:\n  - `0`: success\n  - `1`: unexpected/internal error\n  - `2`: usage / argument parse error\n- Behavior:\n  - Typer handles parse errors -\u003e exit `2`\n  - controlled operational errors (e.g., cannot write `--out`) -\u003e exit `1` with a clear message including the path\n  - in `--json` mode, errors should prefer a JSON shape printed to stdout or stderr (pick one and be consistent), but must remain non-zero exit\n\n## Observability\n- Minimal strategy:\n  - default: quiet except for success and errors\n  - `--verbose`: debug logs to stderr (e.g., resolved output path, write steps)\n\n## Security \u0026 Privacy\n- Do not print prompt content (not supported in this issue anyway).\n- Respect user-provided paths only.\n- Avoid reading repository content in this issue; keep the scaffold isolated.\n\n## Rollout / Migration\n- Ship the CLI scaffold early so dependent M0 issues can build on stable command names.\n- If command renaming becomes necessary, add compatibility aliases (where feasible) rather than breaking dependents.\n\n## Testing Plan\n- Unit tests for CLI argument parsing:\n  - `pm --help` contains expected command names\n  - `pm prd --help` works\n  - missing `--out` produces usage error (exit code `2`)\n- Integration/smoke tests:\n  - `pm --version`\n  - `pm prd --out \u003ctmpfile\u003e` writes the stub file and exits `0`\n  - `pm prd --out \u003cunwritable path\u003e` exits non-zero and emits an actionable error\n  - `pm prd --out \u003ctmpfile\u003e --json` emits valid JSON\n\n## Open Questions\n1. Should `pm` ship any command aliases (e.g., `pm` only vs also `prd-agent`)? Current assumption: `pm` only.\n2. Should `--json` output go to stdout (recommended) even on errors, or should errors always go to stderr?\n3. Should `pm prd` create parent directories for `--out`, or fail if they do not exist?","notes":"Added a mandatory dirty-working-tree decision gate to docs (.opencode/command/implement.md + docs/Workflow.md).

{"id":"beads-testing-t31","title":"Add template usage guidance to bd onboard output","description":"## Feature Request\n\nUpdate the `bd onboard` command output to include guidance on when and how AI agents should use templates when creating issues.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, `bd onboard` provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents but doesn't mention the template system. This leads to AI agents creating minimal issues without the structured documentation that templates provide. Adding template guidance would:\n\n1. Improve issue quality by encouraging use of structured templates\n2. Ensure bugs include reproduction steps and environment details\n3. Ensure features capture design decisions and alternatives considered\n4. Maintain consistency across issues created by different AI agents\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **AI Agent Onboarding**: When a new AI agent runs `bd onboard`, it learns to use templates for bugs, features, and epics automatically\n2. **Existing Projects**: Teams can regenerate AGENTS.md with updated best practices by re-running `bd onboard`\n3. **Documentation Consistency**: All projects using beads get consistent, high-quality issue documentation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify the `bd onboard` command output in two places:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md content**: Update the \"Create new issues\" section to show template usage:\n   ```bash\n   # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n   bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n   bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Templates section** after \"MCP Server\" section with:\n   - List of available templates (bug, feature, epic)\n   - When to use each template\n   - When to skip templates (tasks/chores)\n   - Template viewing commands\n\n3. **Update Important Rules** to include: \"Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\"\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Add template suggestions to `bd create` command itself (e.g., prompt \"Use --from-template?\")\n  - Why not chosen: Too intrusive for human users who may prefer quick issue creation\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Create separate `bd onboard --with-templates` flag\n  - Why not chosen: Splits the onboarding experience; templates should be default best practice","design":"## Technical Design\n\nThe `bd onboard` command outputs hardcoded markdown strings. This feature requires updating the string constants in the Go source code.\n\n**File to modify**: `cmd/onboard.go` (or similar in beads source)\n\n**Changes needed**:\n1. Update AGENTS.md template string to include template examples in \"Create new issues\" section\n2. Add new \"Templates\" section after \"MCP Server\" section\n3. Update \"Important Rules\" to include template usage guideline\n4. Similarly update the .github/copilot-instructions.md template string\n\n## API Changes\n\nNo API changes - only updates to string constants in `bd onboard` output.\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\nNo database schema changes required.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The exact file location may vary (likely in `cmd/` directory)\n- Both AGENTS.md and copilot-instructions.md templates need updates\n- Keep changes minimal - just add template guidance to existing structure\n- Match existing formatting and style conventions\n- Test by running `bd onboard` and verifying output\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- **Manual testing**: \n  1. Run `bd onboard` in a test directory\n  2. Verify AGENTS.md includes template examples\n  3. Verify Templates section is present with correct content\n  4. Verify Important Rules includes template guidance\n  5. Check copilot-instructions.md similarly\n  \n- **Integration tests**: Add test case that parses `bd onboard` output and verifies template sections exist\n  \n- **Regression testing**: Ensure existing onboard functionality remains unchanged (file creation, directory structure)","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] `bd onboard` output includes template usage examples in 'Create new issues' section\n- [ ] New 'Templates' section is added to AGENTS.md template with complete guidance\n- [ ] 'Important Rules' section includes template usage guideline\n- [ ] .github/copilot-instructions.md template similarly updated with template guidance\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms correct output in new projects\n- [ ] Existing `bd onboard` tests pass without modification\n- [ ] Documentation (if any) about `bd onboard` is updated to mention templates\n- [ ] Changes submitted as PR to beads upstream repository","notes":"Reference implementation: This project's AGENTS.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md files contain the exact changes needed.\n\nUpstream repo: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\n\nNext steps:\n1.
