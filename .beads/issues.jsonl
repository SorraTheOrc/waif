{"id":"wf-58w","title":"Build countdown timer application with Agent Mail integration","description":"## Feature Request\n\nBuild a real-world countdown timer application that demonstrates Agent Mail integration for cross-agent communication and coordination.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAgent Mail (https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) is an MCP server that enables AI agents to communicate asynchronously via a message queue system. Building a countdown timer application serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. **Learn Agent Mail**: Practical experience with MCP-based agent communication\n2. **Real Application**: Create a useful tool (multiple timers with alarms)\n3. **Demonstrate Coordination**: Show how agents can coordinate on building a complete application\n4. **Test Workflow**: Exercise beads issue tracking in a realistic development scenario\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Multiple Timers**: User can create multiple countdown timers running simultaneously\n2. **Timer Management**: Start, pause, resume, cancel, and reset individual timers\n3. **Visual Display**: Show remaining time for all active timers\n4. **Audio Alarms**: Sound notification when timer completes\n5. **Persistent State**: Save timer state so they survive application restart\n6. **Agent Coordination**: Use Agent Mail for agents to coordinate implementation tasks\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a terminal-based countdown timer application with:\n\n**Technology Stack**:\n- Python or Node.js for the application\n- Agent Mail MCP server for agent-to-agent communication\n- Sound library for alarms (e.g., playsound, beep, or system notification)\n- Simple TUI or CLI interface\n- JSON file for persistence\n\n**Agent Mail Usage**:\n- Coordinate development tasks between multiple AI agents\n- Use message queues to assign subtasks (UI, timer logic, alarm system, etc.)\n- Demonstrate asynchronous agent communication patterns\n\n**Features**:\n- `timer add \u003cname\u003e \u003cduration\u003e` - Create new timer (e.g., \"5m\", \"2h30m\")\n- `timer list` - Show all active timers\n- `timer pause \u003cname\u003e` - Pause a timer\n- `timer resume \u003cname\u003e` - Resume a paused timer\n- `timer cancel \u003cname\u003e` - Cancel a timer\n- `timer reset \u003cname\u003e` - Reset timer to original duration\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Build a web-based timer with real-time updates\n  - Why not chosen: More complex, focus should be on Agent Mail integration not web development\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Simple single-timer application\n  - Why not chosen: Too basic, doesn't showcase agent coordination or complex state management\n  \n- **Alternative 3**: Pomodoro timer specific\n  - Why not chosen: Less flexible than general countdown timers","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-16T12:51:31.969126204-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T13:45:05.826156917-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"wf-58w","depends_on_id":"wf-dt1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T16:41:23.490283632-08:00","created_by":"rogardle"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-18T13:45:05.826156917-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

{"id":"wf-t31","title":"Add template usage guidance to bd onboard output","description":"## Feature Request\n\nUpdate the `bd onboard` command output to include guidance on when and how AI agents should use templates when creating issues.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, `bd onboard` provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents but doesn't mention the template system. This leads to AI agents creating minimal issues without the structured documentation that templates provide. Adding template guidance would:\n\n1. Improve issue quality by encouraging use of structured templates\n2. Ensure bugs include reproduction steps and environment details\n3. Ensure features capture design decisions and alternatives considered\n4. Maintain consistency across issues created by different AI agents\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **AI Agent Onboarding**: When a new AI agent runs `bd onboard`, it learns to use templates for bugs, features, and epics automatically\n2. **Existing Projects**: Teams can regenerate AGENTS.md with updated best practices by re-running `bd onboard`\n3. **Documentation Consistency**: All projects using beads get consistent, high-quality issue documentation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify the `bd onboard` command output in two places:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md content**: Update the \"Create new issues\" section to show template usage:\n   ```bash\n   # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n   bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n   bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Templates section** after \"MCP Server\" section with:\n   - List of available templates (bug, feature, epic)\n   - When to use each template\n   - When to skip templates (tasks/chores)\n   - Template viewing commands\n\n3. **Update Important Rules** to include: \"Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\"\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Add template suggestions to `bd create` command itself (e.g., prompt \"Use --from-template?\")\n  - Why not chosen: Too intrusive for human users who may prefer quick issue creation\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Create separate `bd onboard --with-templates` flag\n  - Why not chosen: Splits the onboarding experience; templates should be default best practice","notes":"Reference implementation: This project's AGENTS.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md files contain the exact changes needed.\n\nUpstream repo: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\n\nNext steps:\n1. Fork the beads repository\n2. Locate the onboard command source (likely cmd/onboard.go)\n3. Apply the template guidance additions shown in this project\n4. Test with 'bd onboard' in a fresh directory\n5.
