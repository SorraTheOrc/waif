(At minimum: open/in_progress/closed; others appear in Beads output.) Proposed: support `open`, `in_progress`, `done`, `closed`, `tombstone`.\n\n- Acceptance criteria\n  - [ ] A new function exists that returns `\u003ctypeSym\u003e \u003cstatusSym\u003e \u003ctitle\u003e` with optional truncation.\n  - [ ] If `maxLen \u003c= 0` then no truncation occurs.\n  - [ ] If truncation occurs, returned string contains `...` and `len(result) \u003c= maxLen` always.\n  - [ ] Glyphs/symbols come from a config file with sensible defaults.\n  - [ ] Unit tests cover types/statuses and truncation edge cases.\n\n- Proposed next step\n  - Implement in `src/lib/` and wire into list outputs later.\n","notes":"PR: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/wafi/pull/7","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T11:27:34.05515748-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T15:13:42.422575288-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T15:13:42.422575288-08:00","close_reason":"Closed PR #7","external_ref":"PR: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/wafi/pull/7"}

Provide the same command surface (`pm`, `pm prd`) and UX primitives (help, `--json`, `--verbose`, exit codes), keeping behavior stubby but ready for M0 follow-on work.\n\n## Goals\n- Deliver a TypeScript entrypoint `pm` runnable via npm/yarn/pnpm (`npx pm` and installed binary).\n- Keep the initial subcommand surface identical: `pm prd --out \u003cpath\u003e [--json] [--verbose]`.\n- Establish shared CLI scaffolding: command registration, result/JSON emission, error/exit-code mapping, and verbose logging.\n- Generate a stub PRD file to prove FS write path end-to-end.\n\n## Non-goals\n- Real PRD generation or prompt ingestion (follow-on issues).\n- TUI/interactive flows.\n- Telemetry/auth/config persistence.\n\n## Architecture\n- **Language/Tooling**: TypeScript targeting Node 18+, built with `ts-node`/`tsx` for dev; bundled to a dist folder via `tsc` for publish.\n- **CLI framework**: Commander (lightweight, battle-tested, good help UX). Alternative acceptable: oclif; prefer Commander for minimal footprint.\n- **Project layout**:\n  - `src/index.ts`: bootstraps Commander program, registers subcommands, exports `run()` for tests.\n  - `src/commands/prd.ts`: implements `prd` subcommand.\n  - `src/lib/io.ts`: small helpers for stdout/stderr writes (human vs JSON), structured error typing, exit-code mapping.\n  - `src/types.ts`: shared result/error shapes.\n- **Packaging**:\n  - `package.json` with `bin: { \"pm\": \"./dist/index.js\" }`.\n  - Scripts: `build` (tsc), `start` (tsx src/index.ts), `lint` (optional), `test` (vitest or jest; prefer `vitest` for speed/TS-native).\n  - Type definitions emitted to `dist/` alongside JS for consumers/tests.\n\n## CLI Surface \u0026 Behavior\n- Root: `pm`\n  - Global flags recognized on root and subcommands: `--json`, `--verbose`, `--version`, `--help` (Commander standard).\n- Subcommand: `pm prd --out \u003cpath\u003e`\n  - Validates `--out` presence; usage errors exit with code 2.\n  - Creates parent directories if missing.\n  - Writes stub Markdown with a heading and placeholder sections (e.g., Title, Summary, Requirements).\n  - Success output:\n    - Human: `Wrote PRD stub to \u003cresolvedPath\u003e` to stdout.\n    - JSON: `{ \"out\": \"\u003cresolvedPath\u003e\", \"stub\": true }` to stdout.\n  - Verbose: emit diagnostics to stderr (resolved path, write start/end).\n\n## Error Handling \u0026 Exit Codes\n- Exit codes: `0` success; `1` controlled operational error; `2` usage/parse error (Commander default for missing required options).\n- Controlled errors (e.g., unwritable path) throw typed `CliError` with `exitCode` and `message`; handler maps to exit and stderr, respecting `--json` by emitting `{ error: { message, code } }` to stdout.\n- Unexpected exceptions fall back to exit `1` with a terse message.\n\n## Testing Plan (Node/TS)\n- Unit/CLI tests with `vitest` + `execa` (or `node:test` + `child_process`) against the built CLI:\n  - `pm --help` shows `prd`.\n  - `pm prd --help` works.\n  - Missing `--out` -\u003e exit 2.\n  - Success write to temp file -\u003e exit 0 and file contents include stub header.\n  - JSON mode emits valid JSON with `stub: true`.\n  - Unwritable path -\u003e exit 1 with actionable message.\n- Optional: snapshot stub content to keep structure stable.\n\n## Migration Notes (from Python scaffold)\n- Maintain the same command names and flag semantics to avoid breaking dependents.\n- Replace Typer-specific behaviors with Commander equivalents; keep exit codes aligned (2 for parse errors, 1 for operational errors).\n- Provide npm/yarn install instructions; drop Python-specific install steps.\n- Consider a thin compatibility note in README once implementation lands.","notes":"Added a mandatory dirty-working-tree decision gate to docs (.opencode/command/implement.md + docs/Workflow.md).

Should the doc cross-references continue pointing at wf-ca1, or be updated to reference wf-dt1 (or another successor) instead?\n\n- Proposed next step:\n  - UPDATE PRD at: `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` (only if we want to change cross-references away from wf-ca1)\n  - Recommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md wf-ca1`\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-18T13:12:40.598302523-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T11:21:19.802456129-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T11:21:19.802456129-08:00","close_reason":"Completed: documented and resolved undefined wf-ca1 blocker","labels":["Chore"]}

{"id":"wf-t31","title":"Add template usage guidance to bd onboard output","description":"## Feature Request\n\nUpdate the `bd onboard` command output to include guidance on when and how AI agents should use templates when creating issues.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, `bd onboard` provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents but doesn't mention the template system. This leads to AI agents creating minimal issues without the structured documentation that templates provide. Adding template guidance would:\n\n1. Improve issue quality by encouraging use of structured templates\n2. Ensure bugs include reproduction steps and environment details\n3. Ensure features capture design decisions and alternatives considered\n4. Maintain consistency across issues created by different AI agents\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **AI Agent Onboarding**: When a new AI agent runs `bd onboard`, it learns to use templates for bugs, features, and epics automatically\n2. **Existing Projects**: Teams can regenerate AGENTS.md with updated best practices by re-running `bd onboard`\n3. **Documentation Consistency**: All projects using beads get consistent, high-quality issue documentation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify the `bd onboard` command output in two places:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md content**: Update the \"Create new issues\" section to show template usage:\n   ```bash\n   # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n   bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n   bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Templates section** after \"MCP Server\" section with:\n   - List of available templates (bug, feature, epic)\n   - When to use each template\n   - When to skip templates (tasks/chores)\n   - Template viewing commands\n\n3. **Update Important Rules** to include: \"Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\"\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Add template suggestions to `bd create` command itself (e.g., prompt \"Use --from-template?\")\n  - Why not chosen: Too intrusive for human users who may prefer quick issue creation\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Create separate `bd onboard --with-templates` flag\n  - Why not chosen: Splits the onboarding experience; templates should be default best practice","design":"## Technical Design\n\nThe `bd onboard` command outputs hardcoded markdown strings. This feature requires updating the string constants in the Go source code.\n\n**File to modify**: `cmd/onboard.go` (or similar in beads source)\n\n**Changes needed**:\n1. Update AGENTS.md template string to include template examples in \"Create new issues\" section\n2. Add new \"Templates\" section after \"MCP Server\" section\n3. Update \"Important Rules\" to include template usage guideline\n4. Similarly update the .github/copilot-instructions.md template string\n\n## API Changes\n\nNo API changes - only updates to string constants in `bd onboard` output.\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\nNo database schema changes required.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The exact file location may vary (likely in `cmd/` directory)\n- Both AGENTS.md and copilot-instructions.md templates need updates\n- Keep changes minimal - just add template guidance to existing structure\n- Match existing formatting and style conventions\n- Test by running `bd onboard` and verifying output\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- **Manual testing**: \n  1. Run `bd onboard` in a test directory\n  2. Verify AGENTS.md includes template examples\n  3. Verify Templates section is present with correct content\n  4. Verify Important Rules includes template guidance\n  5.
